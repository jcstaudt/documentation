## What is so unique?

The TERES-I laptop is a completely open source hardware and software product.
You don't even need to purchase the device to access the design files.
The CAD files and full source code are available at [GitHub](https://github.com/OLIMEX/DIY-LAPTOP) and anyone can download, modify and use them for their own needs.
KiCad (the CAD design tool that we used to design the TERES-I hardware) is also completely free and open source.

The openness of the product puts incredible power and flexibility in the hands of the user.
If you want to implement new features, you are free to do so.
If you need another processor, more power, more memory, a better LCD, you have everything required to tailor this laptop according to your needs.
If you do not like the Linux distribution, you have access to the sources and can generate any Linux distribution for your taste.
For systems with the Allwinner A64 processor, the Android SDK can be used as an operating system alternative.

The laptop is fully modular, meaning that there are numerous possible ways to expand it.
For example, the capabilities of the laptop may be enhanced by implementing a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) so it can function as a digital storage oscilloscope and logic analyzer, thus turning it into a powerful portable laboratory instrument.
Development of these FPGA expansion modules are currently in progress; you can follow their development on the [OLIMEX web site](https://www.olimex.com).

TERES-I is environmentally friendly.
All components of the TERES-I are available for individual purchase, so you can replace just the broken part if one were to fail.
This lowers maintenance costs and helps reduce electronic waste.
The main board may also be upgraded without requiring major changes to the rest of the computing system, vastly reducing cost, waste and time when improved processors become available.

There are educational benefits in constructing and using the TERES-I.
You can assemble it with your children and teach them about electronics or how computers work.
Children may learn about fundamental computing components, how parts and circuit boards are assembled together, and are able to learn to conduct repairs in case something eventually goes wrong.
This may also spark their interest in electronics and programming!
