# What's next?

This product is a [work-in-progress](../../../resources/Evaluation-Board-Notice.md).

## More capability

We are designing new main boards with newer and more powerful processors with more RAM and NAND flash (the trade-off would be a shorter battery life, of course).

TERES-I comes with 1376x768 LCD configuration.
Future main boards aim at 1920x1080 pixels.

## More extensibility

A set of expansion boards are being considered that can turn the TERES-I into a "portable lab".
This may include capabilities such as a digital storage oscilloscope and logic analyzer.

Different main board configurations: the first iteration comes with ARM64 and x86 support.
The MIPS architecture is coming soon with other architectures to follow.
The concept is to make templates which others may use to customize so other SOCs may be used for a main board.

## More adoption

Being OSHW, community members are welcome to release their own ideas, software and hardware projects and designs compatible with the TERES-I.
We would love for you to help [contribute](https://github.com/OLIMEX/DIY-LAPTOP/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
