# Where may I find the source files?

The TERES-I [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OLIMEX/DIY-LAPTOP) is the primary location of TERES-I source and design files.
The entire laptop design consists of a single repository.
There is currently no effort planned to split the design into additional projects.

## Hardware

Hardware portions of the project are located [here](https://github.com/OLIMEX/DIY-LAPTOP/tree/master/HARDWARE).

More is to come in the future.
TERES-I main board PCBs are expected be released which support other processors.

## Software

Software portions of the project are located [here](https://github.com/OLIMEX/DIY-LAPTOP/tree/master/SOFTWARE).
This folder contains the scripts for building the official Linux image.
Scripts for Android will be added once available.
