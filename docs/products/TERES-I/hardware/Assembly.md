## Preparation

Prepare a workspace with enough room and light to assemble the laptop.
Cover the workspace with soft material to prevent scratching the laptop's plastic parts.
Ideally use a grounded electronics mat to protect the sensitive electronic components.
Read and follow the instructions carefully and do not rush!
Disassembling the finished unit to fix earlier mistakes is considerably harder than assembling the unit!

## [Included Materials](Package-Contents.md)

## Touchpad

The assembly process begins with the **TERES-006-Keyboard**:

![TERES-006-Keyboard 1](images/009.jpg) ![TERES-006-Keyboard 2](images/056.jpg)

Attach the touchpad **TERES-023-Touch** to the keyboard body:

![TERES-023-Touch 1](images/043.jpg) ![TERES-023-Touch 2](images/042.jpg)

The touchpad uses double-sided adhesive tape.
Remove the protective paper backing on the side of the sensor containing the white connector.
Place the touchpad on the top side of TERES-006-Keyboard with the sensor facing underneath, as shown in the pictures below.
Be careful to place the touchpad connector so that it faces the correct way!
The exposed pins of the connector must be pointing **upward**.
The touchpad snaps tightly to the upper side plastic.
You should place the TERES-006-Keyboard on an even surface and make sure the touchpad connector is fully inserted.

![Tape install 2](images/061.jpg)

![Touchpad connector](images/062.jpg)

Next, turn over the TERES-006-Keyboard so that the keyboard keys are facing upward.
Remove the paper backing from **TERES-023-Touch** and **TERES-022-Touch-Cover**.

![Tape install 1](images/060.jpg) 

Align the top edge of the TERES-022-Touch-Cover over the TERES-023-Touch and carefully press it down over the sensor.
With the TERES-006-Keyboard on a flat surface, firmly press down on all sections of the TERES-022-Touch-Cover to ensure complete adhesion.

Now, orient the **TERES-010-Touch-Btns** the correct way and press the piece firmly into the touchpad button holes:

![TERES-022-Touch-Cover](images/041.jpg) ![TERES-010-Touch-Btns](images/017.jpg)

The final result looks like this:

![Keyboard top](images/063.jpg) ![Keyboard bottom](images/064.jpg)

## Touchpad Buttons

The next step is to attach the TERES printed circuit boards to the keyboard body.
For this purpose use the **TERES-014-Screw-Set**.
Note that in this set there are 42 screws of different lengths:

* M2 x 1.5 ( 4 pcs)
* M2 x 3   ( 9 pcs)
* M2 x 4   (17 pcs)
* M2 x 5   (12 pcs)

It is a good practice to:

* Sort all the screws before you begin, as each screw must be placed in a specific location based on length
* Do not mix the lengths of the screws during installation; doing so may damage the plastic parts
* Be gentle! Do not torque the srews as tight as possible; this may break the plastic

All screws have same diameter (**M2**), but different lengths.
Use a metric ruler if you have difficulties determining the length.
For example, the **M2 x 5** screw would have **5mm** thread length (i.e. not including the head).

For the PCBs the **M2 x 3** screws must be used.

Now we assemble the **TERES-PCB3-Touch** PCB:

![TERES-PCB3-Touch 1](images/065.jpg) ![TERES-PCB3-Touch 2](images/066.jpg)

It is shown below, attached to the keyboard body.
Note that only the middle screw is used.
The other two screws will later be used when fixing the bottom plastic cover:

![Keyboard bottom](images/067.jpg)

The next PCB to attach is the **TERES-PCB2-IO**:

![TERES-PCB2-IO 1](images/068.jpg) ![TERES-PCB2-IO 2](images/069.jpg)

The PCB2 board has a microphone which has to be placed in the side pocket specially designated for it.

## Microphone

![Microphone](images/070.jpg)

After the microphone is put in place, slip the board at an angle into the side openings for the SD card, USB, and audio connector, then place it down.

![Placement](images/071.jpg)

Then use one **M2 x 3** screw to fix the board:

![Keyboard bottom](images/072.jpg)

Please make sure that the side connectors are well aligned:

![Keyboard side](images/073.jpg)

## Power Button

Next you put the PWR button plastic:

![PWR button install](images/074.jpg) ![PWR button](images/015.jpg)

Then the LED pipe:

![LED Pipe install](images/075.jpg) ![LED Pipe](images/023.jpg)

Next attach the TERES-PCB4-Btn (the power button):

![TERES-PCB4-Btn 1](images/076.jpg) ![TERES-PCB4-Btn 2](images/077.jpg)

The TERES-PCB4-Btn is attached with two **M2 x 3** screws with the connector pointing to the right side:

![TERES-PCB4-Btn 3](images/078.jpg)

## Mainboard

The next step is to assemble the big **TERES-PCB1-A64**:

![TERES-PCB1-A64 1](images/079.jpg) ![TERES-PCB1-A64 2](images/080.jpg)

This is the main board and you should handle it very carefully.
Do not bend it, do not drop it, etc.
This board is very sensitive to static electricity; a grounding strap is recommended for use during handling.

It is a bit tricky to place the mainboard in the correct position as you must slide it in a way that the connectors enter properly in the plastic body side openings.
If you succeed you will see all the PCB support nuts from the keyboard body pass exactly through the openings of the PCB.
You need to use two **M2 x 3** screws to attach it:

![TERES-PCB1-A64 3](images/081.jpg)

Again, ensure that the side connectors are properly aligned:

![Keyboard left](images/082.jpg)

## Cabling

Now connect **TERES-PCB2-IO** with **TERES-PCB1-A64**.
For this purpose, use the Flat Cable **TERES-027-FPC-IO-Main**. 

![TERES-PCB2-IO 1](images/083.jpg)

There are two 40-pin connectors on **TERES-PCB2-IO** and **TERES-PCB1-A64**.
You have to open the latch â€“ pull the dark plastic of the connector up and insert the FPC cable above it with the contacts up:

![TERES-PCB2-IO 2](images/084.jpg)

After you have inserted the cable, push the dark plastic back down so it locks the cable to the connector:

![TERES-PCB2-IO 3](images/085.jpg)

Repeat the same with the **TERES-PCB1-A64**.
**TERES-PCB2-IO** and **TERES-PCB1-A64** are now connected together:

![TERES-PCB2-IO 4](images/086.jpg)

Do the same for **TERES-PCB4-Btn** and **TERES-PCB1-A64**.
Use the small flat cable **TERES-028-FPC-Pwr-Main**.
These connectors are similar to the previous ones.
You should again disengage the lock (pull the dark plastic up), then insert the flat cable with the contacts pointing UP between the white and dark plastic then push the dark plastic back.
Here is the flat cable connected to both connectors:

![TERES-PCB4-Btn](images/087.jpg)

The next step is to connect the touch panel **TERES-023-Touch** to the board with touch buttons **TERES-PCB3-TOUCH**.
Use the flat cable **TERES-029-FPC-Touch-Btn**.
Note that these connectors are different; the touch panel connector has a hinge and the dark plastic gets opened upside as on this picture:

![TERES-023-Touch 1](images/088.jpg)

The flat cable is also inserted with the contacts pointing down and blue back up:

![TERES-023-Touch 2](images/089.jpg)

The connector on **TERES-PCB3-TOUCH** is also different so the cable is inserted below the dark plastic again with blue back pointing up:

![TERES-023-Touch 3](images/090.jpg)

You have to bend the cable twice.
Do not bend at a very sharp angle and don't bend it too hard, or else it might get damaged!

The next step is to attach the **TERES-PCB5-KEYBOARD** to the keyboard flat cable as shown on the picture below.
Note that the cable goes under the black sliding plastic of the connector:

![TERES-PCB5-KEYBOARD 1](images/091.jpg)

Do not assemble the keyboard PCB to the plastic base at this time.

The next step is to connect **TERES-PCB5-KEYBOARD** with **TERES-PCB3-TOUCH**.
Use the **TERES-031-FPC-Kbd-Btn** flat cable for this purpose.
The cable is inserted with contacts up above the black plastic of the connector, in the same way as the power button and main board cables:

![TERES-PCB5-KEYBOARD 2](images/092.jpg)

![TERES-PCB5-KEYBOARD 3](images/093.jpg)

Next connect **TERES-PCB5-KEYBOARD** with **TERES-PCB1-A64** and using one **M2 x 3** screw attach **TERES-PCB5-KEYBOARD** to the plastic body.
Note that only the left screw is placed.
The right screw will be installed later when attaching the bottom plastic.

## Speakers

The final assembly step is to attach the left and right speakers.
Look at the bottom side you will notice that **right** speaker is assembled at the **left** hand side, and the **left** speaker at the **right** hand side.

For this purpose use **M2 x 4** screws and only screw in the upper one.
The speaker connectors should be inserted in **TERES-PCB2-IO** and **TERES-PCB1-A64** boards.

## Body Panels

Now continue with LCD frame assembly using the **TERES-008-LCD-Back** as base:

![TERES-008-LCD-Back 1](images/094.jpg)

First attach the metal hinges to the **TERES-016-Hinge-Set** using 8 pcs M2 x 4 screws:

![TERES-008-LCD-Back 2](images/095.jpg)

Next attach **TERES-026-LCD-cable** to the **TERES-015-LCD** 11.6" panel ([datasheet](../datasheets/TERES-015-LCD11.6/N116BGE-EA2.pdf)):

![TERES-008-LCD-Back 3](images/096.jpg)

With **M2 x 1.5** screws assemble the LCD to the plastic.
Note that only 4 screws are used!

![TERES-008-LCD-Back 4](images/097.jpg) ![TERES-008-LCD-Back 5](images/098.jpg) ![TERES-008-LCD-Back 6](images/099.jpg)

## Camera

Connect the **TERES-019-Camera** to the four pin connector of the **TERES-026-LCD-cable**.
There are two holes in the camera board which attach to two pins on the plastic body.

![TERES-019-Camera 1](images/100.jpg)

![TERES-019-Camera 2](images/101.jpg)

## WiFi

On the other side attach **TERES-025-WiFi-Antenna** with double-sided adhesive tape to the plastic body:

![TERES-025-WiFi-Antenna](images/102.jpg)

## More Cabling

Follow the wiring shown on the picture below for the correct path of the LCD and WiFi cables.
Pay attention on how the cables go around the plastic locks and hinges!
The LCD cable wiring is probably most difficult part of the whole assembly and it is **incredibly important** to keep **EXACTLY** the same layout else the cover will **NOT** snap together properly later.

![TERES-008-LCD-Back 3](images/DSC_1672-Recovered.png)

## Magnet

The **018-Magnet** is placed in special place on the left hand of the LCD:

![018-Magnet](images/104.jpg)

Now place the panel.
If you did the wiring correctly, the panel will snap tightly.
You will have something like this:

![TERES-008-LCD-Back 4](images/105.jpg)

If the panel doesn't snap properly and you have to remove the cover to re-do the wiring, please, be patient else the plastic locks can break.
You can use a credit card or other similar card as a lever to separate the bottom and top parts of the display.

Then fix the upper corners with **M2 x 3** mm screws like this:

![TERES-008-LCD-Back 5](images/106.jpg)

Now place the **TERES-020-Camera-Lens** above the camera sensor and rubber mats over the two screws:

![TERES-008-LCD-Back 6](images/107.jpg)

Now assemble the LCD part with the keyboard body.
Use 6 screws **M2 x 4** mm for this purpose:

![TERES-008-LCD-Back 7](images/108.jpg)

Note that there are four places on the hinges but only three get assembled with screws.
The fourth hole should be left empty; the extra screw will come from the bottom plastic body attachment.
The places where you have to put screws are stamped at the metal hinges with arrows.

Next connect the WiFi antenna cable and LCD cable to **TERES-PCB1-A64**:

![WiFi/LCD](images/109.jpg)

## Battery

The next step is to attach four double adhesive mats that would hold the LiPo battery in place:

![Battery 1](images/110.jpg)

Attach the battery and plug the battery connector to the PCB1.
Mind the orientation of the cable and polarity!
Red cables should go to the left side.

![Battery 2](images/111.jpg)

## Final Steps

Next put the **TERES-021-Dust-Protectors** at the openings of the bottom plastic **TERES-005-Bottom**:

![TERES-005-Bottom 1](images/112.jpg)

In the next image, you see the dust covers placed over the two openings:

![TERES-005-Bottom 2](images/113.jpg)

Next assemble the bottom plastic using 12 **M2 x 5** screws:

![TERES-005-Bottom 3](images/114.jpg)

The final step is to attach the rubber mats to the four locations at the bottom:

![TERES-005-Bottom 4](images/115.jpg)

The assembly is now complete.
Now press the power button and the laptop will boot:

![TERES-Assembled](images/116.jpg)

Congratulations! You assembled your TERES-I laptop!
